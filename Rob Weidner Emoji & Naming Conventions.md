# Rob Weidner Emoji & Naming Convention Guide

Adding emojis to fields serves to clarify their purpose for our team during maintenance, while most importantly, signaling to clients that these emoji-labeled fields should not be altered or removed without prior approval. Changing them could risk breaking the associated solution.

Emojis are useful in naming conventions because they visually help differentiate various parts of a system, especially as complexity increases. They also facilitate error detection when fields should have specific values indicated by emojis, ensuring automations work as expected.

To improve visual reference and API accessibility, please include emojis at the start of the names for fields, automations, and scenarios.
